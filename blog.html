                   on  Makhalima street. The concert you'll see a light skinned boy right there.
                   Whenever the kids in the street would see Trevor  they would yell and say  to 
                   each other to have a look at the white man, some of the kids would  run away to
                   call their parents to see  the white man , while others would  run up trying to
                   touch him,  if  he is really real. Other kids had  had no clue genuinely what  a white <br>
                   person  clue.This made him have many friends in the streets of Soweto  where the
                   population was high constant with the black people.</p>
